Description
===========

- You have to cross the road to the other side.
- There are cars moving in the road, at different speeds.
- You can't collide with them.
- If a collision occurs, the player is moved back to the starting point, and a life is taken away.
- Once there's no more lives, the game ends.
- If the player crosses the road, that level is successfully completed.
- Try to finish all the levels in the shortest time.


Controls
