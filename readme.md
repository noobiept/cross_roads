# Description

-   You have to cross the road to the other side.
-   There are cars moving in the road, at different speeds.
-   You can't collide with them.
-   If a collision occurs, the player is moved back to the starting point, and a life is taken away.
-   Once there's no more lives, the game ends.
-   If the player crosses the road, that level is successfully completed.
-   Try to finish all the levels in the shortest time.

# Controls

Use the arrow keys (or wasd keys) to control the player movement.
